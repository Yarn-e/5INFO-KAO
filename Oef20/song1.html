					<p>
						Have you got color in your cheeks'
						Do you ever get the feeling that you can't shift the tide
						That sticks around like something's in your teeth
						And some aces up your sleeve
						I had no idea that you're in deep
						I dreamt about you near me every night this week
						How many secrets can you keep'
						'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow
						When I play it on repeat
						Until I fall asleep
						Spilling drinks on my settee
					</p>

					<p>
						(Do I wanna know?)
						If this feeling flows both ways
						(Sad to see you go)
						Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
						(Baby we both know)
						That the nights were mainly made for saying 
						things that you can't say tomorrow day
					</p>
					<p>
						Crawlin' back to you.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
						'Cause I always do
						Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
						Now I've thought it through
					</p>
					<p>
						Crawling back to you
					</p>
					<p>
						So have you got the guts?
						Been wondering if your heart's still open and
						if so I wanna know what time it shuts
						Simmer down and pucker up
						I'm sorry to interrupt it's just I'm constantly 
						on the cusp of trying to kiss you
						I don't know if you feel the same as I do
						But we could be together, if you wanted to
					</p>
					<p>
